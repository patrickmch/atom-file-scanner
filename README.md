This is currently very much a WIP. So far scrolling up or down in the Fuzzy
Finder will open a file in a pending view.

To Do:
* Clean up unused boilerplate
* Test more to see what happens with big files (is it too slow?)
* Make the code DRY(er)
* See if you can open files in search view in a similar way
* Install it as an actual plugin for your testing use
* Make a settings view with an option that allows people to customize their keymap
